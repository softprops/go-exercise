// Bulls and Cows
//
// You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.
//
// You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:
//
// The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
// The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
// Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.
//
// The hint should be formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.
